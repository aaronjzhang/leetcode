#3Sum Closest
Given an array S of n intgers, find three intgers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number. Return the sum of three intergers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

```
For example, given array S = { -1, 2, 1, -4 }, and target = 1. 
the sum that is closest to target is 2. ( -1 + 2 + 1 ).
